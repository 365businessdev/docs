## What costs are incurred by the use?

The [address prediction](address-prediction.md) function is already paid for as part of the user licensing for the 365 business Address Validation App. There are no further usage-based costs for the use of [address prediction](address-prediction.md).

The [address validation](address-validation.md) function is based on the 365 business API Cloud Service - Address Validation, which is usually billed on a per-use basis. The respective costs depend, among other things, on the number of addresses validated.
