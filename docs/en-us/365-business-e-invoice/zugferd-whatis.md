# What is ZUGFeRD?

ZUGFeRD Support
ZUGFeRD (Central User Guide of the Forum for Electronic Invoices in Germany) is a standardized format for the exchange of electronic invoices, primarily designed to make electronic invoicing accessible to small and medium-sized businesses. ZUGFeRD invoices combine human-readable PDFs with machine-readable XML data, enabling both manual and automated processing of invoices.

## What is ZUGFeRD?
ZUGFeRD is the latest version of the standard, designed to align with international formats such as the European EN16931 standard for electronic invoices in the public sector. By adhering to this standard, ZUGFeRD 2.0 ensures seamless interoperability across different countries and systems.

* Automated Processing: Incoming invoices can be automatically read and processed, reducing manual effort and errors.
* Flexibility: ZUGFeRD is suitable for businesses of all sizes and can be integrated into existing IT systems with ease.
