# Introduction

Companies are legally required to regularly check their business partners against sanction lists to ensure that they do not conduct business with sanctioned individuals, groups, or organizations. This obligation arises from various EU regulations and the Foreign Trade and Payments Act (AWG).

The most important legal bases include:

- **EU Regulations:** In particular, Regulation (EC) 881/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001, which establish restrictive measures against certain individuals and organizations.
- **UN Sanction Lists:** These serve as the basis for European and national sanction lists. All UN member states are required to avoid the listed individuals.

Companies must ensure that they regularly conduct sanction list checks. This includes matching data about business partners or employees with the entries in the relevant sanction lists.
