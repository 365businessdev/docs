# Setup

On the **365 business API Setup** page, all relevant information for setting up and using the 365 business API is provided.

The page includes the following sections:

## General

The General section contains two pieces of information:

### API Address (URL)

Specifies the URL for connecting to the 365 business API services. The value is set automatically during installation and does not need to be changed.
The default value is: `https://api.365businessapi.com`

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <i class="fa-duotone fa-solid fa-circle-info fa-xl"></i>
    <strong>Info</strong> Customers with a development access can enter the URL to the development system in this field. Transactions with the development system are not charged. However, please note that the data sent to the development system is not encrypted and can be further processed by our team.
</div>

### Transmission of Telemetry Data
Allows the sending of anonymized telemetry data for the use of 365 business API services. The telemetry data helps us to further improve our services and functions and to identify problems and errors.

    <strong>Info</strong> For more information about which data is collected, please see <a href="telemetry-data.md">Telemetry</a>.
