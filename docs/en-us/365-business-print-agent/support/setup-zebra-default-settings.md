# Zebra Driver Default Settings

## Problem

Labels printed manually from your Zebra printer look perfect – but when printed via the **365 business Print Agent**, they may appear:

- misaligned  
- blank  
- mirrored  
- rotated  
- or difficult to read

---

## Cause

If you are using a computer as a **print server**, the **printer settings must be configured system-wide** – for **all users** who print through the server.  
This includes parameters like:

- print speed  
- print density / darkness  
- ribbon usage  
- label offsets

---

## Solution

The Zebra printer driver provides two types of configuration:

1. **User-specific settings** – only apply to the current user
2. **System-wide defaults** – *must be configured to ensure all users share the same print behavior*

### How to set default values for all users:

1. Open **Start > Settings > Printers & Scanners**
2. Select your Zebra printer and click **Manage**
3. Click **Printer properties**
4. Go to the **Advanced** tab
5. Click **Printing Defaults**
6. Adjust your desired settings here (e.g., speed, darkness, etc.)
