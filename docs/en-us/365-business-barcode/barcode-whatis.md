## What is a barcode?

There are many different types of barcodes. They all consist of optical patterns and encode data so that it can be read automatically or by machine. The German term for barcode is Strichcode, as it is made up of parallel bars of varying widths and gaps.

However, the term barcode is often equated with the EAN barcode known from product packaging. As the name EAN barcode suggests, this code encodes the product's global article number, known then as EAN and now as GTIN. This makes it quick and easy to scan the product at the supermarket checkout.

## How and where are barcodes used?

There are many possible uses for barcodes. Below you will find some practical examples:

 - As consumers, we encounter the most prominent example virtually every day when shopping in the supermarket. There we find the EAN barcode on product packaging. This is used for fast and error-free checkout of goods at the cash register, but also for inventory management.
 - In industry, barcodes are used to record goods movements and stock levels.
 - In logistics and shipping service providers, the barcode has a permanent place in status tracking and documentation.
 - Barcodes are also an important component for the traceability of goods.

## What information is contained in a barcode?

Depending on the purpose, various information can be encoded in a barcode. For example, it can be the following:

 - The EAN barcode on product packaging in supermarkets encodes the product's article number (GTIN, formerly EAN), ensuring that the product can be easily and quickly recorded at the checkout.
 - In logistics, the GS1-128 barcode encodes the SSCC. With the help of the SSCC, any type of transport unit, e.g. pallets or cartons, can be identified.
 - GS1 data identifiers can also be used to encode other information, such as batch number or best before date, in GS1 barcodes.
