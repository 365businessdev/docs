# Payment Journal

The payment journals in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central are the central place for initiating outgoing payments. A bank account and a payment method are assigned to the journal. The payment method determines whether it is a SEPA transfer, a SEPA instant transfer, or a SEPA direct debit.

Accordingly, there can be one or more payment journals for each bank account, each configured for a specific payment method. This allows for flexible handling of payments and easy adaptation to specific requirements.

## Making Payments

To initiate payments, use the payment journals in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Follow these steps:

1. Select **Payment Journals** in the search of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.
2. Select an existing journal for your bank account and payment method or create a new journal.
3. Choose the action **Edit Journal** to modify the journal.
4. Enter the journal lines for your payments, or use the action **Suggest Payments** to automatically generate payment suggestions.
5. Review the journal lines and ensure all information is correct. Pay particular attention to amounts, payment references, and the recipient's bank account.
6. Choose the action **Process Payments** to process the payments.
7. Confirm the execution of the payments and the posting of the journal.

    <strong>Good to know</strong>
    The payment journal also offers the action <strong>Process and Post Payments</strong>. This action combines the execution of payments with the posting of the journal in one step.<br>This is especially useful if you want to post the payments immediately.

## Posting Payments

After processing the payments, the journal lines in the payment journal can be posted. If the action **Process and Post Payments** was used, the posting is done automatically. Otherwise, you need to manually post the payment using the **Post** action in the payment journal.
