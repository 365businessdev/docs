# ZKA Codes (Transaction Codes)

The ZKA Code (Transaction Code, GV-Code) is a three-digit numeric identifier in German payment transactions that describes the type of banking transaction. It originates from the FinTS/HBCI and DFÃœ specifications of the German Banking Industry Committee (formerly ZKA). The use of the ZKA Code is optional but recommended to improve the assignment of payments to open entries or general ledger accounts.

365 business Banking supports the use of ZKA Codes in payment reconciliation. During the installation of 365 business Banking, the most common ZKA Codes are automatically set up. However, you can also add your own ZKA Codes or modify existing codes to meet your specific requirements.
