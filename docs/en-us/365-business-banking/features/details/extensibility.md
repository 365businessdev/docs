# Extensibility

## Business Value

The extensibility of 365 business Banking enables companies to customize the functionality of the solution to their specific business requirements. By providing APIs and other integration points (e.g., Event Publisher), companies can develop custom extensions that can be seamlessly integrated into their existing systems and processes.

Additionally, 365 business Banking provides central interfaces that allow developers to integrate their own payment service providers (PSP). This offers companies the flexibility to select the most suitable PSP for their needs and integrate it into their payment processes.
