# Multi-Level Approval

## Business Value

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Standard already supports approval workflows for various business processes. Among other things, approval can be set up for General Journal and General Journal Lines. However, these approval workflows are limited to a single approval level, which can lead to challenges in more complex organizational structures with multiple hierarchy levels.

Multi-level approval workflows enable companies to define approval processes that require multiple levels of approvals. This is particularly useful in larger organizations where different departments or hierarchy levels need to be involved in the approval process. By implementing multi-level approval workflows, companies can ensure that all relevant stakeholders are included in the approval process, leading to better control and transparency.

## Feature Description

With the multi-level approval feature in 365 business Banking, companies can implement complex approval processes in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, based on the Workflow module. This feature enables the creation of approval workflows that require multiple levels of approvals before a posting is finally approved and processed.
