# SEPA Standing Order - Cashflow Integration

## Business Value

Standing orders are a widely used method to automate recurring payments, such as rent, subscriptions, or membership fees. The integration of SEPA standing orders in 365 business Banking enables companies to efficiently manage and automate their recurring payments by importing and managing them directly in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

The amounts are plannable and help companies better control their liquidity and avoid financial bottlenecks.

## Feature Description

The integration of SEPA standing orders from 365 business Banking into the Cashflow module of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central allows users to consider the plannable expenses as **neutral expenses** in the cashflow. The SEPA standing orders are treated as recurring transactions in the cashflow module and will be automatically included in the cashflow planning.
