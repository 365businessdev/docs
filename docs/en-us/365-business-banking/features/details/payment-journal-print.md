# Payment Journal Print

## Business Value

The Payment Journal is the foundation for outgoing payments in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and already supports essential functions for the approval process. However, some companies need the ability to create a physical printout of the journal to review or archive it as part of their internal control system.

## Feature Description

With the Payment Journal print function in 365 business Banking, users can generate the journal in a printable format. This enables users to create a physical copy of the journal that can be used for review, approval, and archiving purposes. The printout contains all relevant journal information, including payment details, recipient data, and the bank account to be used.
