# Multi-User Bank Account Login

## Business Value

In some companies, it is common for multiple users to need access to a shared bank account to manage payments and conduct transactions. However, the PSD2 standard requires that each person accessing a bank account be individually authenticated. In some banks, this is possible through the setup of multi-user access, which allows multiple users to log in with their own credentials and access the same bank account.

    <strong>Good to Know</strong>
    Most banks support specifying multiple devices for authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)) for a single user access. In this case, it is not necessary to set up separate user access for each user, as long as all users have access to the registered devices.
