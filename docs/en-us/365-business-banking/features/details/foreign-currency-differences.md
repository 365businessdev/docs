# Handling Exchange Rate Differences in Foreign Currency Accounts

## Business Value

Companies that use foreign currency accounts and post invoices in the corresponding foreign currency often face the challenge that Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central captures exchange rate differences even though no actual currency transactions have taken place. This can lead to discrepancies in financial reports and requires additional administrative effort to explain and correct these differences.
