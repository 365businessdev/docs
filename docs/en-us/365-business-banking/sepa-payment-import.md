# SEPA Payment Import

With the SEPA payment import feature, you can import SEPA payment files in SEPA pain.001 XML format (ISO 20022) into Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and execute the payments. This feature facilitates the processing of SEPA transfers generated by external systems (e.g., payroll systems).

## Which SEPA Payment Files Are Supported?

365 business Banking supports SEPA payment files in pain.001 XML format that comply with ISO 20022 standards. The import checks the SEPA version based on the namespace (pain.001.*) and is therefore generically compatible with all common SEPA Credit Transfer formats. The following versions are supported:

| Version            | Description                                                                  | Supported |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **pain.001.001.03** | Classic SEPA Credit Transfer format (widely used, `<BIC>` tag)               | <i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-check"></i> |
| **pain.001.001.04** | National extension / transition variant, rarely in use                      | <i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-check"></i> |
| **pain.001.001.05** | Extension with additional fields (e.g., Category Purpose)                   | <i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-check"></i> |
| **pain.001.001.06** | Updated SEPA version (2014 ff., standard in many banks)                     | <i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-check"></i> |
| **pain.001.001.07** | Minor revision with formal clarifications                                   | <i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-check"></i> |
| **pain.001.001.08** | ISO update 2019, still with `<BIC>` tag                                    | <i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-check"></i> |
| **pain.001.001.09** | ISO 20022 Release 2023, new tags (e.g., `<BICFI>`, `<InstrPrty>`)         | <i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-check"></i> |

## Which Payment Types Are Supported?

The SEPA payment import supports the following payment types:

<ul>
<i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-check"></i> SEPA transfer<br>
<i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-check"></i> SEPA bulk transfer<br>
<i aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-check"></i> SEPA scheduled transfer
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-notice">
   <i class="fa-duotone fa-solid fa-lightbulb fa-xl"></i>
   <strong>Good to know</strong>
   If the selected bank account does not support SEPA bulk transfers, these will automatically be executed as individual SEPA transfers.
