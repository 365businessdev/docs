The action *Apply Changes* applies the changed address values to the source data record (e.g. customer).

The action *Discard Changes* discards the changes, data is not changed in the source data record.

##### How can I change suggested address data?

The AssistEdit `...` button next to the respective address field can be used to manually change the suggested field value. 365 business Address Validaition saves this manual adjustment for the future to prevent repeated corrections.
Your manual input will be defined as default.
