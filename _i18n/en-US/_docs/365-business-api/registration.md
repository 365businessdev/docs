Registration is performed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central via the registration wizard.

>Info<br>Registration is necessary for the use of the 365 business API. After successful registration, a free 30-day trial period begins during which you can use all services of the 365 business API without any restrictions.

During registration, some information will be collected, which enables a later upgrade of the trial license into a usage-based billing model. 

#### What will my data be used for?
Your data will only be used for allocation and billing purposes. If you do not convert your trial license into a full-fledged usage-based subscription, your data will be automatically deleted after a retention period of 100 days.

#### Can I register more than once?
Registration is only possible once for each e-mail address. The encrypted e-mail address is also stored beyond the retention period of 100 days to prevent multiple registrations.

#### Are there any costs for or after the registration?
No, there are no costs within the trial period of 30 days. After the trial period expires, the API key is automatically locked and can only be used again if a subscription is taken out. This ensures that no accidental costs are incurred after the trial period expires.
