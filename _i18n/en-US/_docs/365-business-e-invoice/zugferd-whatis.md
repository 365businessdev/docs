ZUGFeRD Support
ZUGFeRD (Central User Guide of the Forum for Electronic Invoices in Germany) is a standardized format for the exchange of electronic invoices, primarily designed to make electronic invoicing accessible to small and medium-sized businesses. ZUGFeRD invoices combine human-readable PDFs with machine-readable XML data, enabling both manual and automated processing of invoices.
