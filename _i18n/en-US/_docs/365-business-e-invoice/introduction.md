From January 1, 2025, a new legal regulation will come into force in Germany that will make the receipt of electronic invoices mandatory for companies. This measure aims to reduce the administrative burden, digitize accounting and combat tax evasion. From this date, companies must receive and process their invoices in a standardized electronic format (e.g. ZUGFeRD).

Our 365 business E-Invoice app helps companies to easily meet these requirements. It enables electronic invoices to be imported directly from Outlook mailboxes or via drag & drop. The integration of Microsoft Copilot AI further automates invoice import. The system attempts to automatically assign the invoices to the existing orders in the system. If this is not possible, a new invoice is created without an order assignment and the wizard helps with the manual correction and assignment of the invoice lines.

In addition to the obligation in Germany, electronic invoices are also gradually becoming mandatory in other European countries. Poland, for example, will introduce a national e-invoice system for B2B transactions from July 1, 2024, and Romania will start transmitting e-invoices in real time from January 2024.

Thanks to the support of the ZUGFeRD 2.0 standard (profile EN16931), our product can also convert conventional invoices into the required electronic format and optionally send them automatically to recipients.

### Advantages of 365 business E-Invoice:

* **Automated Import:** Import and process purchase invoices and credit notes directly from Microsoft 365 mailboxes or via drag & drop.
* **Automated Export:** Create ZUGFeRD-compliant sales invoices and credit notes and send them via email.
* **AI-supported Assignment:** Automatic recognition and assignment of invoices to orders and line items with the support of Microsoft Copilot.
* **ZUGFeRD Standard:** Support for the ZUGFeRD 2.3 - EXTENDED profile (EN16931 compliant) for creating and processing electronic documents.
* **Assisted Error Correction:** If the automatic assignment fails, our wizard helps to manually assign details correctly.

With 365 business E-Invoice, companies are ideally prepared to meet the upcoming regulatory requirements and make their processes efficient and future-proof.
