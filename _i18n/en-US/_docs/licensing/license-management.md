License management takes place entirely within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. All essential management tasks can be carried out directly by you. In this section, you will learn how to manage your licenses.

For license management, the **365 business development License** extension is automatically installed during the installation of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central apps and extensions. This extension adds license management and verification to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

License management can be accessed via the **Extension License Management (365 business development)** page:
