This page describes how to activate a license for an app or extension. License activation is necessary to use the app or extension in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central after the trial period ends.

License activation is accessed through the **Extension License Management (365 business development)** page. During license activation, you can select the [licensing method](../license-methods/), subscription period, and desired payment method. Additionally, Microsoft partners can activate the license for the end customer.
