Some apps or features include a certain number of uses (e.g., number of barcodes per billing period) and may incur additional costs if exceeded. To avoid unexpected costs, you can set a spending limit. The spending limit defines the maximum number of uses that can be performed within a billing period. Once the spending limit is reached, the use of the app or feature is blocked until the billing period ends or the spending limit is increased.
