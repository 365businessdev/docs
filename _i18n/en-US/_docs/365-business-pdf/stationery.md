With 365 business PDF you can underlay PDF files generated from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central with a stationery (PDF file). This eliminates the need to create and maintain additional report layouts.

The setup takes place in the **PDF Stationery Configurations** page. Here, multiple stationery configurations can be created. For example, it is possible to store different or no stationery for each page.

#### How do I create a stationery configuration?

1. Open the page **PDF Stationery Configurations**.
2. Select **New**.
3. Specify a value in **Code** field.
4. Specify a **Description** for the configuration.
5. Create a new configuration line.
6. Select the **Stationery Type** to specify where the PDF file should be applied as stationery.
7. Select the **PDF File Code** for the PDF file you want to concatenate.
   > **Note**<br>PDF files must be created in the [PDF files](../pdf-files/) page before use.
