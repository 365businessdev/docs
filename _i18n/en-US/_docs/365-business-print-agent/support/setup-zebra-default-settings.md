#### Problem
The labels you print manually on your Zebra printer look perfect. However, the labels printed through the 365 business Print Agent are hard to read, shifted, blank, rotated or reversed.

#### Reason
If you are using a computer as a print server, you must ensure that all users of the print server have the same print settings (e.g. speed, brightness, color band usage, etc.).

#### Solution
There are two locations in a Zebra printer driver that allow the possibility of changing printer settings. One location is for user-specific settings, the other, described here, is for *all* users.
To change printer driver defaults for all users connecting to shared printers:

1. Open **Start > Settings > Printers & Scanners**.
2. Click your printer, then click **Manage**.
3. Click **Printer properties**.
4. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
5. Click **Printing Defaults**.
6. Change your settings.
