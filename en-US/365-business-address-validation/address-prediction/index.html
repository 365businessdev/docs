<h4 id="what-additional-information-is-obtained-from-organizations-and-companies">What additional information is obtained from organizations and companies?</h4>

<p>The additional information depends on the actual data available in our data sources. Usually, however, in addition to the postal address and the company name, the following information is determined:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homepage</li>
  <li>Phone No.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-are-only-a-maximum-of-four-results-displayed">Why are only a maximum of four results displayed?</h4>

<p>In <a href="../setup/">Address Validation Setup</a> you can specify the max. number of predictions shown initially. The default value is four, but can modified according to the business needs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tip</strong><br />By clicking the “Load more…” action in the address prediction list, all additional predictions will be shown.</p>
