<meta name="description" content="365 business Print Agent is a modern print solution designed for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, to introduce seamless printing experience in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. 365 business Print Agent allows you to access your printer infrastructure in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and specify Printer Configurations for each printer which can be assigned or directly used within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Print Agent is supporting both SaaS environments and On-Premise environments of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central to access your printer infrastructure. Print Agent basically consists of at least two components, the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central app, available through Microsoft AppSource, and the Print Agent Service (connector). Print Agent supports every printer with Microsoft Windows compatible drivers or printer software. Architecture 365 business Print Agent is able to operate in two separate so-called Service Modes, the 365 business Print Agent Cloud and the Direct Connection mode. Good to know!365 business Print Agent service and the 365 business Print Agent app support both service modes and the modes can be switched everytime, after initial set up.Please keep in mind, that existing configurations will be removed prior changing the service mode in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Print Agent Cloud (recommended) Using the 365 business Print Agent Cloud is the most recommended way to operate Print Agent, because the necessary setup is reduced to a minimum and usually no complex adjustments to firewalls or network routes are necessary. Basically the 365 business Print Agent Cloud is usually up-and-running out-of-the-box after installation and basic set up. Communication between the Print Agent Service and the Cloud is implemented via state-of-the-art technologies, such as SignalR, and all data is transmitted in transport encrypted form. Good to know!The 365 business Print Agent Cloud service is hosted in Germany and does not store any print job or printer data. The service acts like a relay and creates a real-time connection to the Print Agent Service (connector).Your data is absolutely safe and will never be stored or analyzed for any reason.

				<h3>What is Print Agent?</h3>
			</div>
			<article class="content">
				<p>365 business Print Agent is a modern print solution designed for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, to introduce seamless printing experience in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. 365 business Print Agent allows you to access your printer infrastructure in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and specify <a href="../printer-configuration/">Printer Configurations</a> for each printer which can be assigned or directly used within Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/365-business-print-agent/print-agent-logo.png" alt="365 business Print Agent" /></p>

<p>Print Agent is supporting both SaaS environments and On-Premise environments of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central to access your printer infrastructure.</p>

<p>Print Agent basically consists of at least two components, the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central app, available through Microsoft AppSource, and the <a href="../print-agent-client-whatis/">Print Agent Service</a> (connector). Print Agent supports every printer with Microsoft Windows compatible drivers or printer software.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>365 business Print Agent is able to operate in two separate so-called Service Modes, the 365 business Print Agent Cloud and the Direct Connection mode.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Good to know!</strong><br />365 business Print Agent service and the 365 business Print Agent app support both service modes and the modes can be switched everytime, after initial set up.<br />Please keep in mind, that existing configurations will be removed prior changing the service mode in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="print-agent-cloud-recommended">Print Agent Cloud <em>(recommended)</em></h4>

<p>Using the 365 business Print Agent Cloud is the most <em>recommended</em> way to operate Print Agent, because the necessary setup is reduced to a minimum and usually no complex adjustments to firewalls or network routes are necessary. Basically the 365 business Print Agent Cloud is usually up-and-running out-of-the-box after installation and basic set up.</p>

<p>Communication between the Print Agent Service and the Cloud is implemented via state-of-the-art technologies, such as SignalR, and all data is transmitted in transport encrypted form.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Good to know!</strong><br />The 365 business Print Agent Cloud service is hosted in Germany and does not store any print job or printer data. The service acts like a relay and creates a real-time connection to the Print Agent Service (connector).<br />Your data is absolutely safe and will never be stored or analyzed for any reason.</p>

<h4 id="direct-connection">Direct Connection</h4>

<p>The direct connection mode of 365 business Print Agent is only recommended for on-premises environments of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, due to the much higher effort to configure firewalls, network routes and many more, to allow a secure and reliable access from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central SaaS environments.</p>
